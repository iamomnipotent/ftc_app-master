FTC 6128's RES-Q code.

<b>GENERAL ISSUES</b>

The main FTC SDK updates regularly and so does the Android 4.4 SDK. When checking for updates, download and unzip the latest FTC SDK release to root folder and update Android SDKs through the SDK manager within Android Studio.

Do not modify opmode files with default names ('NullOp', etc) as new updates will replace those files.

Update CHANGELOG.md and KNOWNISSUES.md each time a new release involving <b>direct changes to a java class</b> is committed using format set out in those files.
